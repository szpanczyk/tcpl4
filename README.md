This repository will include short programs related to my study of "The C++ Programming Language (rth ed.)" by Bjarne Stroustrup.

This repository is mostly intended as part of my "portfolio", to showcase my approach to learning and level of knowledge I have. As such, most of it will be only interesting to people, who want to assess my value to their organization. It might be though, that parts of this repository will turn out or become in time worthwhile educational material for others - but this is not the aim at the moment.

As of the moment I am writing this readme, I am at the beginning of the book. Looking for a job after a period of inactivity (during which I did not code regularly at all), I realized that I need to refresh and restructure my knowledge of C++ programming language as a priority. The kind of C++ Developer jobs I am aiming for demand understanding of new standards and I am severely lacking even when it comes to C++11 features, which 4th ed. of the book covers.

Book, as a project, includes exercises, but those are not part of the printed version. They are instead available on author's website: https://stroustrup.com/4thExercises.pdf

This repository will include:
/exercise - solutions, if applicable, to author's exercises, or otherwise programs related to problems posed by Mr. Stroustrup
/practice - programs I write as I read through the book, to ensure I properly remembered old and learned new concepts
/other - it happens often to me, that when I read about one feature or concept, I have a follow up question or interesting idea that I want to test out, that goes deeper into subject; code included here will be only loosely related to part of the book that inspired it.
