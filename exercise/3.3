Q:  List three (or more) C++ compilers.

A:  I've been using g++ since forever. This is a part of Gnu Compiler Collection, released on GPL license. It's possible to use it on Windows, ie. via MinGW.

    I've heard that Intel's compiler produces more efficient code for their platform, but doesn't work well with AMD CPU's.

    I did not realize until searching for an answer to this question that Visual Studio uses (by default, I suppose) a separate compiler, which seems to be called msvc.

    Interesting bend to this question is - which compiler is good for use in critical mission applications.  But that will have to wait for now: TODO
