Q:  What is an invariant and what good might it do?

A:  An invariant is a certain statement about object's state which should remain true throughout it's existence. If we properly design, understand and never invalidate invariants of our class, we are able to rely on the class as a part of a system or application.
    Invariants are a way of thinking about our classes that helps us create error-free code, which is easy to develop and maintain, as well as safe.
